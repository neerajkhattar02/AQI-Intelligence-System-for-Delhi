# AQI Intelligence System for Delhi

A full-stack **Air Quality Intelligence Web App** that analyzes pollution levels in Delhi and provides **personalized lifestyle advice** using machine learning and real-time weather data.

Built to help users make safer daily decisions like **whether to go outside, exercise, or stay indoors** based on air quality risk.
